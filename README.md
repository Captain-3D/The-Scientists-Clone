# The-Scientists-Clone

Gameplay:
	
	A 3D rouge lite game where you are a mad scientist that is traveling form planet to planet (for some reason). The planets are dangerous so you clone yourself, so that your clone may venture down onto the planet, fighting all that he may find while increasing his stregth and finding lpoot at the same time. 

	This clone is the player and everytime the player dies, a new clone is created. 

	The player may use what he found on the planet to go back to the scientists spaceship to prepare and upgrade the next clone before the player dies. If the player dies, he loses everything on him. Things on the spaceship remain. 

	UNDECIDED: The spaceship can only remain at a planet for a certain amount of time before the player must return. maybe this can tie into why the scientist is running in the first place. he is running away form some mega corp and cant stay at a planet long before they catch up, something like that.

	UNDECIDED: The spaceship also has fuel that the player must worry about.
	UNDECIDED: The spaceship can be upgraded to improve things like its engine(speed/fuel economy), storage(for storiing thigns the player collects), planet scanner(give more information about a planet before player sets foot on it), etc.

	The things that the player can find:
		A form of text that describes a skill that the player can "equip" onto a clone. (only a certain number of skills may be quiped at a given time. something like 4)
		Blueprints of weaoons or armour that the player may created(meaning there has to be a form of material gathering for craftng) 
			OR players may find straight up weapons or armour laying around on a planet.
		UNDECIDED: A form of currency.

	This is primarly single player game.
		UNDECIDED: 2-4 player co-op (risk of rain style?)

	The spaceship is not really an area you can walk around in but more of a menu where you can store/retrieve items, outfit next clone, or move to another planet.

	The planet is a proceduely generated sphere that the player will be able to walk around on and fight.
		The planets may have different levels of gravity.
		different stylkes and sizes.

	There are 4 different weapon styles that the player can choose from
		Melee (swords, axes, ets)
		UNDECIDED: Magic (Fireball, ice spear, etc.)
		Ranged (archery, maybe guns)
		throwing (grenades, throwing knives, javelins, etc)

	There are skills that are fighing style dependent, for example a skill like a mega slash requires a melee weapon
		Might change all of the magic fighting style to be skills instead.

	UNDECIDED: Not really sure of an end game
		Some form of boss (Maybe the megacorp that the scientist is running from?)
		A legendary planet that must be found and cleared?
